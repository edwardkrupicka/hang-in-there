//    The name of this function is slightly different than its functionality.
//    The functionality to me is more akin to `displayRandomPoster()`

//  COMMENT #3:
//    After reviewing `makeCustomPoster`, I dislike that this function and that function are handling setting
//    the main poster display differently. This one isn't setting the `currentPoster` variable
//    with a new instance of `Poster`, and the other is not. I think you should always strive to solve the same
//    problem the same way. You could probably create a single reusable function in both places.
